# Notes

## Role

You are a senior front-end engineer. Your task is to **re-evaluate and refactor the repository Gravity Notes** according to the coding standards already written in **AGENTS.md**.

## Context

* AGENTS.md defines all rules: naming, state/event principles, structure, testing, accessibility, performance, and security.
* The repo uses Alpine.js, CDN scripts only, no bundlers.
* Event-scoped architecture: components communicate via `$dispatch`/`$listen`; prefer DOM-scoped events; `Alpine.store` only for true shared domain state.

## Rules of engagement

Review the NOTES.md. Make a plan for autonomously fixing every item under Features, BugFixes, Improvements, Maintenance. Ensure no regressions. Ensure adding tests. Lean into integration tests. Fix every issue. Document the changes.

Fix issues one by one. 
1. Create a new git branch with descriptive name
2. Describe an issue through tests. Ensure that the tests are comprehensive and failing to begin with.
3. Fix the issue
4. Rerun the tests
5. Repeat 2-4 untill the issue is fixed and comprehensive tests are passing
6. Write a nice comprehensive commit message AFTER EACH issue is fixed and tested and covered with tests.
7. Optional: update the README in case the changes warrant updated documentation
8. Optional: ipdate the PRD in case the changes warrant updated product requirements
9. Optional: update the code examples in case the changes warrant updated code examples

Do not work on all issues at once. Work at one issue at a time sequntially. 

10. Mark an issue as done ([X])in the NOTES.md after the issue is fixed: New and existing tests are passing without regressions
11. Commit the changes and push to the remote.

Leave Features, BugFixes, Improvements, Maintenance sections empty when all fixes are implemented but don't delete the sections themselves.
